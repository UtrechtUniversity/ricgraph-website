These items can be obtained from various systems and from multiple organizations. Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about these items because it infers new relations between items, relations that are not present in any of the separate source systems. It is flexible and extensible, and can be adapted to new application areas.</p><h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1><p>Ricgraph, also known as Research in context graph, is software that is about relations between items. These items can be collected from various source systems and from multiple organizations. We explain how Ricgraph works by applying it to the application area <em>research information</em>. We show the insights that can be obtained by combining information from various source systems, insight arising from new relations that are not present in each separate source system.</p><p><em>Research information</em> is about anything related to research: research results, the persons in a research team, their collaborations, their skills, projects in which they have participated, as well as the relations between these entities. Examples of <em>research results</em> are publications, data sets, and software.</p><p>Example use cases (and subgraphs) from the application area research information are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph/blob/main/docs/images/journalist-use-case.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph/blob/main/docs/images/journalist-use-case.jpg?raw=true" width="400" align="right"></a>As a journalist, I want to find researchers with a certain skill S and their publications, so that I can interview them for a newspaper article.

However, by using Ricgraph, these use cases (and many others) are easy to answer.</p><p>Although the text above illustrates Ricgraph in the application area research information, the principle “relations between items from various source systems” is general, so Ricgraph can be used in other application areas.</p><h1 id="main-contributions-of-ricgraph">Main contributions of Ricgraph</h1><ul><li>Ricgraph can store many types of items in a single graph.</li><li>Ricgraph harvests multiple source systems into a single graph.</li><li>Ricgraph Explorer is the exploration tool for Ricgraph.</li><li>Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about items because it infers new relations between items.</li><li>Ricgraph can be tailored for an application area.</li></ul><h1 id="more-information">More information</h1><p>You might want to continue reading at <a href="learn-more-about-ricgraph.html">Learn more</a>, to <a href="read-more-about-ricgraph.html">Read more</a>, or to <a href="get-ricgraph.html">Get Ricgraph</a>.</p></div></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="./what-is-ricgraph.html" target="_self">What is Ricgraph?</a></li><li><a href="./learn-more-about-ricgraph.html" target="_self">Learn more</a></li><li><a href="./read-more-about-ricgraph.html" target="_self">Read more</a></li><li><a href="./get-ricgraph.html" target="_self">Get Ricgraph</a></li><li><a href="./contact.html" target="_self">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><h6>You are visiting one of the Ricgraph websites <a href="https://www.ricgraph.eu">www.ricgraph.eu</a>, <a href="https://www.ricgraph.nl">www.ricgraph.nl</a>, or <a href="https://www.ricgraph.com">www.ricgraph.com</a>.</h6></footer></div></div></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script></body></html>
