For example, you can find out what data sets or software are produced in your faculty. Or the skills of all persons in your department. Of course this is only possible in case you have harvested them.</li><li>You can find out with whom a person shares research output types. For example, you can find out with whom someone shares software or data sets.</li><li>You can get tables showing how you can enrich a source system based on other systems you have harvested. For example, suppose you have harvested both the <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure">Research Information System Pure</a> and <a href="https://openalex.org">OpenAlex</a>, using this feature you can find out which publications in OpenAlex are not in Pure. You might want to add those to Pure.</li><li>You can get a table that shows the overlap in harvests from different source systems. For example, after a query to show all ORCID nodes, the table summarizes the number of ORCID nodes which were only found in one source, and which were found in multiple sources. Another table gives a detailed overview how many nodes originate from which different source systems. Then, you can drill down by clicking on a number in one of these two tables to find the nodes corresponding to that number.</li></ul><p>With Ricgraph, you can get metadata from objects from any source system youâ€™d like. You run the harvest script for that system, and data will be imported in Ricgraph and will be combined automatically with data which is already there. Ricgraph provides harvest scripts for the systems mentioned above. Scripts for other sources can be written easily.</p><h1 id="more-information">More information</h1><p>You might want to continue reading at <a href="read-more-about-ricgraph.html">Read more</a>, or to <a href="get-ricgraph.html">Get Ricgraph</a>.</p></div></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="./what-is-ricgraph.html" target="_self">What is Ricgraph?</a></li><li class="active"><a href="./learn-more-about-ricgraph.html" target="_self">Learn more</a></li><li><a href="./read-more-about-ricgraph.html" target="_self">Read more</a></li><li><a href="./get-ricgraph.html" target="_self">Get Ricgraph</a></li><li><a href="./contact.html" target="_self">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7524314"><img alt="Static Badge For DOI Software" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI%20%20software-10.5281/zenodo.7524314-blue"></a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101736"><img alt="Static Badge For DOI Reference Publication" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI%20publication-10.1016%2Fj.softx.2024.101736-blue"></a><a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph/"><img alt="Static Badge For GitHub" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph-blue"></a><img alt="Static Badge For Release Date" src="https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph"> <img alt="Static Badge For Release Version" src="https://img.shields.io/github/release/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph?color=green"> <img alt="Static Badge For Commits Since Previous Release" src="https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph/latest?color=green"> <img alt="Static Badge For Last Commit" src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph"> <img alt="Static Badge For License" src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph"><h6>You are visiting one of the Ricgraph websites <a href="https://www.ricgraph.eu">www.ricgraph.eu</a>, <a href="https://www.ricgraph.nl">www.ricgraph.nl</a>, or <a href="https://www.ricgraph.com">www.ricgraph.com</a>.</h6></footer></div></div></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script></body></html>
